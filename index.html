<h1>francisco san</h1>
<p>
francisco san is a hundred thousand dollar fund to make the city and county of san francisco more whimsical through eventures and installations.
</p>

<p>
grantees can be for parties, pop-ups, puzzle hunts, art, races, (un)conferences, distribution of interesting objects or anything in or out between. the only requirement is to have a physical component in the city and county of san francisco.
</p>

<p>
here are some priors on the kind of project that might be funded, refresh for a new one! there is a list of funded projects that may be more informative
</p>

<div id="random-idea">[enable javascript]</div>

<p>
<b>how do i/we apply for a grant?</b></br>
fill out <a href="https://airtable.com/appTbwDK7pCbIL15x/shrjUlC1eMpHeZwbW">this form</a>!
</p>

<p>
<b>will i/we get a rejection email?</b>
</br>
probably not unless it was borderline enough that we feel bad about it.
</p>

<p>
<b>what can i/we spend the money on?</b>
</br>
materials, apparatus, transportation, renting space, hiring people, paying yourselves! maybe a few coins to toss in a fountain for good luck.
</p>

<p>
<b>does francisco san need anything in return?</b>
</br>
please just do the thing well! we also love being able to link to a record of the thing on the site, though it's not very important. 
</p>

<p>
<b>how large are grants?</b>
</br>
grants can be anywhere from zero to nineteen thousand dollars. if your organisation is a 501(c)(3) then grants can exceed nineteen thousand. 
</p>

<p>
<b>how will i/we receive the grant?</b>
</br>
it's pretty ad-hoc as to how money is transferred and when. it's usually an option to receive funds ahead of time. venmo or zelle (unless 501c3) 
</p>

<p>
<b>how can i hear about francisco san projects?</b>
</br>
theyâ€™ll be updated on this website when applicable
</p>

<p>
<b>can i contribute to the francisco san fund?</b></br>
yes! reach out to admin@franciscosan.org. currently we are more limited by producers than money, but pledges of more money are appreciated.
</p>

<p>
<b>what if i am a rich member of technical staff?</b></br>
if motivating yourself with a bounty is useful, then francisco san is for you! resources can be exchanged for agency to some degree.
</p>

<p>
<b>can it be a ___?</b>
</br>
yes.
