<h1>francisco san</h1>
<p>
francisco san is a twenty-five thousand dollar (and possibly expanding) fund to make the city and county of san francisco more whimsical through eventures and installations.
</p>

<p>
grantees can be for parties, pop-ups, puzzle hunts, art, races, (un)conferences, distribution of interesting objects or anything in between. the only requirement is to have a physical component in the city and county of san francisco.
</p>

<p>
here is an example of the kind of project that might be funded, refresh for a new one!
</p>

<div id="random-idea">[enable javascript]</div>

<p>
<b>how do i/we apply for a grant?</b></br>
fill out <a href="https://airtable.com/appTbwDK7pCbIL15x/shrjUlC1eMpHeZwbW">this form</a>!
</p>

<p>
<b>will i/we get a rejection email?</b>
</br>
yes, but only if an email is provided.
</p>

<p>
<b>what can i/we spend the money on?</b>
</br>
materials, apparatus, transportation, renting space, hiring people, paying yourselves! just, be reasonable?
</p>

<p>
<b>does francisco san need anything in return?</b>
</br>
please just do the thing well!
</p>

<p>
<b>how large are grants?</b>
</br>
grants can be anywhere from zero to eighteen thousand dollars.
</p>

<p>
<b>how will i/we receive the grant?</b>
</br>
if thereâ€™s interest after the application, thereâ€™ll be a varying amount of follow-up depending on the nature of the project. if funds are required upfront they will be provided upfront, which can be a venmo transfer, wire transfer or charitable donation (if applicable). budget shifts of a 50% difference are both likely to happen and likely to be reasonable and will be accommodated, though itâ€™s also requested that money be returned if under budget.
</p>

<p>
<b>how can i hear about francisco san projects?</b>
</br>
theyâ€™ll be updated on this website when applicable
</p>

<p>
<b>can i contribute to the francisco san fund?</b></br>
yes! reach out to admin@franciscosan.org. currently we are more limited by producers than money, but pledges of more money are appreciated.

<b>can it be a ___?</b>
</br>
yes.
